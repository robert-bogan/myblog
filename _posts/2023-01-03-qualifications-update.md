Over the years its been quite difficult not to get caught up in the whole "getting qualified" conundrum. My own opinion on this is that you will still learn loads doing training courses even if you don't pass the exam and its sure to keep you out of trouble.

## Credly

Most of my certificates appear in "Credly".

## Acclaim

"Acclaim" is also used for some of my certificates.
