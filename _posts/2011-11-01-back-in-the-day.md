So one day I decided I would get into AWS and I just signed up for an account. I was living in Sydney and I was about to become a father for a second time.

## AWS

### EC2

Just so easy to spin up an instance so I decided I would make a LAMP stack and build an ecommerce site for a fun project to increase my skills. Little did I know what this could lead to. "Just spin up an instance....."

### S3

The first real cloud storge. This is probably the only major public cloud storage at the time and already has an API for the like of DropBox to integrate with.

### Not much else

Thats about all there is in 2011, my memory now feels like digging out a relic when trying to write this post, it just seems like yesterday.

### The future

Nobody knows. Some of the comments from the IBM people around the time made me think that some people thought that AWS would never succeed. **Lesson 1** dont always believe what you hear.
