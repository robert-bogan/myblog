Welcome! Thanks for stopping by. This is my status update for 2022. I should say its really interesting having a blog to keep updated!

I hope to share lessons about the tech I'm passionate about, my hobbies and the personal projects I'm working on, as well as hints and tips from my life experiences. Note I am also crazy about 'pushbikes'.

After around 12 years as a Testing Specialist in Test Automation and Test Management I became a DevOps Engineer and as I speak have around 5 years using this skill in cloud under my belt and love this industry to bits. Currently working as a Principal DevOps Engineer within Platform Engineering in an optimising Kubernetes 'DevOps as a Service' environment.

## Key things I'm passionate about

### Mountain Biking

I've got a Trek Remedy Enduro Trailbike and have experienced the downhill of the [B-Side of Glentress][favourite-trail] in the Tweed Valley. An off piste section that is about as challenging as anything the Scottish Mountain Biking scene has to offer. My favourite rider is [Remy Metallier][favourite-rider]

### Cloud Computing

I've been working in DevOps & Administration with AWS Cloud since 2011, and Microsoft Azure since 2019, after a career working with as a Test Manager and Technical Test Analyst. Its some of the most interesting technology I have ever seen.

### Infrastructure as Code

I'm fully onboard with the DevOps culture and mindset, and the only way to be efficient is to automate and not waste time clicking through a GUI.

s### Scripting

Specifically with Bash, it's hugely versatile, and makes automating tasks, from simple commands, to complex functions easy. Its fun and makes a huge difference and is not difficult to learn

### CD/CD Pipeline

Automating deployments and releases using Azure Pipelines and Jenkins. I see similarities between software delivery & lean manufacturing where many moons ago I worked as a 6 Sigma Process control specialist. Now its all dynatrace and feeding the beast with data & using AI.
