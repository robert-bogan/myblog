Thanks for stopping by. This is my new blog, where I hope to share the tech I'm passionate about, the personal projects I'm working on, as well as hints and tips from my experience.

## Key things I'm passionate about

### Cloud Computing

I've been working with AWS now since 2011, and Microsoft Azure since 2019, after a career working with as a Test Manager and Technical Test Analyst.

### Infrastructure as Code

I'm fully onboard with the DevOps culture and mindset, and the only way to be efficient is to automate and not waste time clicking through a GUI.

### Scripting

Specifically with Bash, it's hugely versatile, and makes automating tasks, from simple commands, to complex functions easy.

### CD/CD Pipeline

Automating deployments and releases using Azure Pipelines and Jenkins.
